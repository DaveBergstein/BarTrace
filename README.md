# BarTrace

Application to track the path and speed of a barbell when weightlifting.

Started by Dave Bergstein (dbergstein@gmail.com)

I'm learning to weightlift and find it helpful to see the path and speed of the barbell of my lifts. I also like experimenting with deep learning. Videos were taken at Grit City in the Bronx where I train (IG @concretejunglegritsc). Randy Triunfel (IG @thebarbellmasochist) is a competitive weightlifter and my coach. Pull Requests welcomed. Feel free to fork and use. I didn't include all the video data here given it's size. The videos were all taken at the gym (pre-pandemic) with either Randy or me, so the model wasn't trained with much variety.

See StartHere.mlx for details and getting started. [![View BarTrace on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/75105-bartrace)
